# Business Performance Overview: Revenue, Profit and Advertising Impact

## Key Outcomes
_ Identified root causes behind negative profit in 20% of top-selling products

_ Uncovered delayed conversion patterns in ad campaigns peaking around final durations and flagged critical inefficiencies including 43% of products generating zero revenue and 18% of regions delivering negative profit, enabling more informed decisions on campaign duration, budget allocation and product-level optimization

## Client Background

The business operates in the Vietnamese fashion market with nationwide coverage. This project focuses on analyzing online marketing campaigns for the women’s fashion category across 62 cities and provinces, spanning Northern to Southern Vietnam, the campaigns were conducted over a one-month period and have entered the review stage. The analysis evaluates campaign performance based on revenue contribution, effectiveness across products, geographic areas and the efficiency of marketing spend allocation. The objective is to support data-driven decisions on whether to maintain or adjust campaign setups, budget distribution, creative strategies and overall marketing execution

## Executive Summary

During 31-day campaign period, advertising played a central role in order generation by contributing 1,958 out of 2,858 orders (68.5%) and approximately 3 billion VND out of 5 billion VND in total revenue. However, profitability did not scale with sales volume: more than 60% of campaign days recorded negative profit, and the ads channel alone showed negative profit on 22 out of 31 days (~70%), despite maintaining positive revenue

Deeper analysis indicates that the core issue is a uniform and prolonged discount policy applied across categories. This policy resulted in systematic profit losses across both ads and direct sales channels. At the same time, conversion performance varies significantly by product category, suggesting that budget allocation and sales strategy should be category-specific rather than evenly distributed

## I. Ads Performance Overview: Spend, Efficiency AND Contribution
### 1. Budget utilization & spend control
Overall, after five weeks, 82.8% of the total budget has been utilized. Weekly actual spend remained 9.3% - 35% below the remaining weekly budget, indicating that ad spend is well controlled with no signs of budget overshoot

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/4f09521eea1d3b953332e885a25ec4a5354bb207/1%20-%20Budget%20control.png)

### 2. ROAS performance
ROAS increased from 5.72 to 9.05 over five weeks, indicating improved ad efficiency toward the end of the period, with each $1 in ad spend generating more revenue. ROAS rose sharply from Week 1 to Week 2 due to the initial traction of the campaign, then stabilized from Week 2 to Week 4 before peaking in Week 5. Notably, 57.5% of total orders were placed in the final two weeks, with the highest order volume on the last day of the month, making Week 5 the lowest-spend yet most efficient period

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/ae1e38aac295a670472e52b09c432d69c25b3865/ROAS.png)

### 3. Ads contribution to total revenue
Ads contribution to total revenue increased from ~59% in Week 1 to ~67% in Week 3, highlighting the growing role of paid ads during mid-campaign period. However, the contribution declined to around 60% by Week 5, indicating a stronger relative contribution from non-ads channels toward the end of period. Combined with higher ROAS and lower ad spend in Week 5, ads remained efficient but were no longer the primary driver of revenue growth in relative terms during the final stage

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/2dde9fc7465e58314b92298e35f835d494d72344/Ads%20contribution%20to%20revenue.png)
![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/2dde9fc7465e58314b92298e35f835d494d72344/Ads%20contribution%20to%20revenue%20-%20table%20view.png)

### Recommendations
_ No immediate need to tighten budget control for the month. The current spending level can be maintained, with potential reallocation toward higher-performing periods or campaigns

_ Although Week 5 recorded the highest ad efficiency, there is no need to increase total ad budget in this stage. Instead, the budget should be reallocated within the existing cap, prioritizing high-performing campaigns while continuing to leverage the contribution of non-ads channels toward the end of the period

## II.	Camps Performance
### 1. High perfomance campaigns
High-revenue and high-profit campaigns are concentrated in core product lines, often deployed across multiple setups (Op / Re), consistently delivering strong ROAS and positive profit, indicating solid demand and stable conversion performance

### Week 1: Campaign launch
Top-performing campaigns were driven by new and seasonal collections, benefiting from strong initial launch traction

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/5183bf3a8b214aadb3fb0ab15ba82ea10f06ad73/Camp%20performance%20-%20week%201.png)

### Week 2 - 3: Growth phase
Campaigns such as AUDREY SHIRT and AVIAN DRESS sustained high revenue and profit across setups, demonstrating scalability with appropriate budget allocation

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/5183bf3a8b214aadb3fb0ab15ba82ea10f06ad73/Camp%20performance%20-%20week%202.png)
![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/5183bf3a8b214aadb3fb0ab15ba82ea10f06ad73/Camp%20performance%20-%20week%203.png)

### Week 4: Category expansion phase
High performance expanded across a broader set of SKUs, while ROAS and profit remained strong, indicating effective portfolio scaling

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/5183bf3a8b214aadb3fb0ab15ba82ea10f06ad73/Camp%20performance%20-%20week%204.png)

### Week 5: Efficiency optimization phase
Campaigns like LISA DRESS and NEVIN DRESS achieved very high ROAS at lower spend, highlighting that setup optimization outperformed budget increases in driving returns

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/5183bf3a8b214aadb3fb0ab15ba82ea10f06ad73/Camp%20performance%20-%20week%205.png)

## Recommendations
_ Standardize proven initial campaign setups that demonstrate delayed but sustained performance (week 3 – 5) into templates, allowing adequate learning time before optimization and budget scaling

_ Scale selectively, prioritizing campaigns with consistent ROAS and profitability over broad budget increases

_ Top performance typically occurred in early phase which was driven by new product launch traction & late phase which was driven by setup optimization and accumulated demand -> campaigns should be managed by lifecycle phase (launch → growth → optimize) to align spend with performance

_ Review and cap budgets for low-performing campaigns; pause if no improvement after 1 – 2 cycles, leveraging non-ads channels to maximize total revenue

### 2. Underperforming Campaigns
Campaigns in this group resulting in negative marketing profit, despite continued ad spend across multiple weeks. This indicates that budget was allocated to setups that failed to generate meaningful business value. A deeper look shows very low ROAS (≈0 – 1) combined with high CPM and CPC but limited clicks and conversions, suggesting inefficient delivery and misalignment in creatives or audience targeting

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/31513455ceab0708b784813debe862acae926ca0/Under-performing%20camp%20(week%204).png)
![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/31513455ceab0708b784813debe862acae926ca0/Under-performing%20camp%20(week%205).png)

## Recommendations
_ Pause or strictly cap campaigns with ROAS < 1, negative revenue & profit

_ Campaigns with high impressions but zero revenue indicate low content effectiveness or misalignment with customer insights. Data suggests the issue lies at the creative and messaging level rather than reach. Prioritize optimizing visuals, messaging and CTAs before increasing budget allocation

_ Campaigns with high CPM and low clicks indicate overly broad or misaligned targeting. Recommend narrowing or refining prospecting audiences, and prioritizing remarketing and high-intent segments with prior purchase behavior to improve efficiency

_ Apply clear performance thresholds: pause campaigns if ROAS < 1 after 1 – 2 optimization cycles, or if marketing profit remains negative despite optimization to prevent repeated budget 
waste in subsequent weeks

_ Reallocate budget toward high-performing campaigns: shift saved spend from underperforming campaigns to those with higher ROAS and profit, particularly setups that have consistently proven effectiveness during weeks 3 – 5

_ Exclude or cap SKUs with zero ROAS or negative profit, and restructure campaigns by SKU performance to concentrate budget on profitable SKUs and improve overall efficiency

## III.	Product Performance
### 1. Higher discount intensity drives profit erosion despite strong sales volume
_ At an overall level, Áo tách set product records negative profit despite strong revenue and sales volume. The scatter chart identifies average discount as the primary driver, with discount effects being amplified by high sales volume, resulting in profit erosion

_ Compared with other categories, Áo tách set product has the largest sales scale, making it more sensitive to discounting. Meanwhile, category Váy Chiết Eo Xòe and Set Váy Áo maintain positive profit due to lower discount levels and healthier margins. In contrast, Chân Váy Tách Set shows margin volatility, requiring closer monitoring during high-discount periods. Weekly analysis confirms a consistent pattern and the drill-through table shows that negative profit is concentrated in Áo tách set SKUs with sustained high discount levels

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/6e7d0f19e91d10fd850dbb1196ff7c394cfd51cb/Category%20performance%20%26%20discount%20on%20price%20impact.png)

*Showing how different discount levels change profit for the Áo tách set product*
![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/6e7d0f19e91d10fd850dbb1196ff7c394cfd51cb/Proof%20of%20discount%20impact%20on%20negative%20profit%20category%20(vay%20chiet%20eo%20xoe).png)

*Showing how different discount levels change profit for Chân váy tách set product*
![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/a637f324ff15dad56c08190a31ece2b1b3504421/Proof%20of%20discount%20impact%20on%202nd%20negative%20profit%20category.png)

## Recommendations
_ Control and reduce discount intensity for Áo tách set to protect profit margins, rather than limiting sales volume

_ Set discount caps for high-volume SKUs to prevent margin erosion as volume scales

_ Optimize pricing and promotion structure, maintaining sales volume while improving profit per unit

### 2. Revenue, Volume & Profitability Trade-offs
_ Cross-metric analysis shows that high revenue and sales volume do not necessarily translate into business effectiveness. Áo Tách Set category ranks high in both revenue and quantity sold, yet records negative profit and profit margin, indicating that margins are insufficient to neutralize the impact of discounting and costs

_ Channel-level comparison shows that categories with negative profit underperform across both Ads and Direct sales, with negative profit and margin in both channels. This indicates that poor performance is not channel-driven, but rather stems from product-level pricing, discount and cost structures

_ In contrast, categories with positive and stable margins (Váy Chiết Eo Xòe, Set Váy Áo, Set Quần Áo) demonstrate consistent profitability across both Ads and Direct sales, suggesting effective pricing and discount strategies, where ads amplify revenue without eroding margins

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/a637f324ff15dad56c08190a31ece2b1b3504421/Category%20perormance%20overview%20(net%20revenue).png)

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/a637f324ff15dad56c08190a31ece2b1b3504421/Category%20perormance%20overview%20(quantity%20sold).png)

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/a637f324ff15dad56c08190a31ece2b1b3504421/Category%20perormance%20overview%20(profit).png)

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/a637f324ff15dad56c08190a31ece2b1b3504421/Category%20perormance%20overview%20(profit%20margin).png)

_ Negative values in profit and margin are not randomly distributed but are concentrated in specific categories and products, particularly Áo Tách Set and Chân Váy Tách Set. This is further reinforced by the ranking table, where loss-making products repeatedly appear, suggesting a structural issue rather than short-term volatility

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/a637f324ff15dad56c08190a31ece2b1b3504421/Products%20with%20negative%20profit%20margin.png)

## Recommendations
_ Control and reduce discount intensity for high volume categories or products with negative margins, rather than limiting sales volume

_ Establish minimum margin or profit thresholds to proactively pause or adjust promotions when performance deteriorates

_ Prioritize scaling benchmark categories with stable margins, while restructuring pricing strategies for loss-making segments

_ Prioritize pricing and discount optimization for loss-making categories before channel-level optimization. Scale Ads only for categories with positive and stable margins, and apply minimum margin thresholds to control performance across both Ads and Direct sales

## IV.	Market Performance

### 1. Revenue scale by region
Hà Nội (36.4%) and Hồ Chí Minh City (21.1%) contribute nearly 57% of total revenue, making them the core markets. With profit margins around the system average (~10%), growth remains stable. Given the high revenue concentration, optimization in major cities will have the greatest impact on overall performance

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/f5b05748ef0d4697cd0d2c0b823ba880fc20d542/High%20revenue%20contribution%20by%20ads.png)

### 2. Profitability by region
Some provinces generate revenue but post negative profit or margins (e.g., Trà Vinh, Kon Tum, Gia Lai) due to low volume and high cost per order. In contrast, provinces such as Hậu Giang, Cà Mau, Ninh Bình, Bắc Giang, and Bình Thuận maintain strong margins (> 15 – 20%) despite smaller scale, reflecting better cost and discount control. Profitability differences are driven by cost structure and sales policies rather than revenue scale alone, and lower volume but high margin areas show potential for scalable growth if optimized

*Low volume and high cost per order areas*

### 3. Revenue contribution by sales channel
Ads-driven revenue is concentrated in major cities and large markets such as Hà Nội, Ho Chi Minh City, Đà Nẵng and Hải Phòng. However, in smaller provinces (e.g., Trà Vinh, Kon Tum, Phú Yên, Bến Tre), ad driven profit and margins are weak or even negative, indicating that ad costs are misaligned with local purchasing power

*High revenue contribution areas*

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/b264e1149ca31ccdb476e98c7db11f925eed2efe/High%20revenue%20contribution%20by%20ads.png)

*Low ads-driven result areas*

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/ae6f465e69490dc5493d2dede15ff99098aaa028/(2)Low%20contribution%20city%20by%20ads.png)

Direct sales deliver more stable and higher profitability in mid-sized provinces such as Vĩnh Phúc, Tuyên Quang, Cà Mau, and Hậu Giang. While revenue contribution is modest, margins remain strong due to lower costs and better discount control. Overall, Ads are effective for scale in large markets, while Direct sales provide more sustainable profitability in non-core regions

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/ae6f465e69490dc5493d2dede15ff99098aaa028/Hight%20profit%20margin%20city%20by%20Direct%20sales.png)

## Recommendations
_ Prioritize Ads investment in top cities, optimizing toward profit and ROAS rather than revenue alone

_ Limit Ads exposure in smaller cities, rely more on Direct sales or tightly controlled testing budgets

_ Set minimum margin thresholds at city level to proactively manage discounting and spend

_ Selectively scale cities with solid margins and moderate volume instead of broad expansion

## Summary
Revenue shows solid growth, while profitability is clearly differentiated across categories, products, regions, and sales channels. Profitability issues are primarily driven by high discount levels in certain categories and regions, particularly through advertising in smaller markets. Focusing on discount control, performance-based budget reallocation, and scaling segments with stable margins is key to improving overall business performance
