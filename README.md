# Business Performance Overview: Revenue, Profit and Advertising Impact

## Key Outcomes
_ Identified root causes behind negative profit in 20% of top-selling products

_ Uncovered delayed conversion patterns in ad campaigns peaking around final durations and flagged critical inefficiencies including 43% of products generating zero revenue and 18% of regions delivering negative profit, enabling more informed decisions on campaign duration, budget allocation and product-level optimization

## Client Background

The business operates in the Vietnamese fashion market with nationwide coverage. This project focuses on analyzing online marketing campaigns for the women’s fashion category across 62 cities and provinces, spanning Northern to Southern Vietnam, the campaigns were conducted over a one-month period and have entered the review stage. The analysis evaluates campaign performance based on revenue contribution, effectiveness across products, geographic areas and the efficiency of marketing spend allocation. The objective is to support data-driven decisions on whether to maintain or adjust campaign setups, budget distribution, creative strategies and overall marketing execution

## Executive Summary

During 31-day campaign period, advertising played a central role in order generation by contributing 1,958 out of 2,858 orders (68.5%) and approximately 3 billion VND out of 5 billion VND in total revenue. However, profitability did not scale with sales volume: more than 60% of campaign days recorded negative profit and the ads channel alone showed negative profit on 22 out of 31 days (~70%), despite maintaining positive revenue

Deeper analysis indicates that the core issue is a uniform and prolonged discount policy applied across categories. This policy resulted in systematic profit losses across both ads and direct sales channels. At the same time, conversion performance varies significantly by product category, suggesting that budget allocation and sales strategy should be category-specific rather than evenly distributed

### Overall Profit Trend by Channel - Channel mix is unlikely to be the primary driver of losses

## I. Marketing Performance – Insights & Recommendations
### 1. Budget Control & Spending Efficiency
Budget utilization was well controlled for over 86% of the campaign duration, Only 13.33% of total days exceeded budget, mainly during the mid and late stages of the campaign

![image alt](https://github.com/mkhanhvo/Business-Performance-Overview-Revenue-Profit-Advertising-Impact/blob/a68cc732f12c57b70d6ac3a97dcaa4549390404e/Overall%20-%20%25%20budget%20used.png)

However, comparison between ad spend, ROAS and revenue shows no clear linear relationship:
- High ROAS and revenue days did not consistently coincide with overspending days
- Several days with controlled spending still delivered weak performance

### -> This indicates that budget level alone is not the primary driver of performance

## Recommendations
_ Avoid optimizing performance solely by increasing or tightening budgets
_ Incorporate creative quality, product category and campaign timing when making scaling decisions

### 2. High Ads Revenue but Weak Profitability
- Out of 2,858 total orders, 1,958 orders (68.5%) were generated through ads, confirming ads as the primary order driving channel. However, when comparing ads spend and ads profit, over 60% of ad days recorded negative profit, regardless of spend level
- From a daily perspective:
+ Only 29% of days (9/31) were profitable overall
+ For the ads channel specifically: 22 days showed negative profit, only 5 days were profitable while the remaining days recorded zero or negative revenue

👉 Ads successfully generate volume but fail to deliver consistent profitability.

## Recommendations
- Shift ad evaluation from revenue generated to revenue generated under a profitable cost structure
- Treat ads as a conditional sales enabler, not a channel for unrestricted scaling.

### 3. Revenue Concentration & Campaign-Level Performance
- Ads revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of core campaigns: top 5 revenue-generating campaigns are mainly driven by Audrey LAL, Flowers Make My Day, Anivan Dress and Margnet Dress
+ Category Vay Chiet Eo Xoe (*waist-flare dresses*) account for over 50% of revenue in the Flowers Make My Day campaign
+ In contrast, clothing sets generate almost no revenue within these high-performing campaigns.

- In terms of ROAS:
+ Category Vay Chiet Eo Om (*waist-fitted dresses*) recorded the highest ROAS (22.9), peaking in Weeks 4–5
+ Campaigns launched earlier (Weeks 1–3) did not achieve comparable efficiency
+ Out of 175 campaigns, only 7 campaigns (~4%) generated zero revenue, indicating that poor performance is not driven by widespread campaign failure.

*Lowest Performing Campaigns by Ad Revenue* 

Recommendations

Reallocate budgets from low-performing campaigns and categories toward proven core campaigns.

Prioritize spending during validated high-performance periods (Weeks 4–5) rather than scaling early.

For the 4% of zero-revenue campaigns, optimize creatives or targeting before elimination
